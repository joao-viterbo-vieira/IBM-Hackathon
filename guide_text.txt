You will require an IAM access token to authorize the prompt code and need to replace 
${YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN} placeholder in the prompt code. You can create an IAM access token using an API 
key.  
• API key: 
Refer to Developer access information to get an API key. 
• Generate IAM Access Token: 
Programmatically generate an IAM access token with the API key using the following cURL command:  
curl -X POST 'https://iam.cloud.ibm.com/identity/token' -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-
urlencoded' -d 'grant_type=urn:ibm:params:oauth:grant-type:apikey&apikey=MY_APIKEY' 
 
• curl -X POST → Specifies an HTTP POST request. 
• URL ("https://iam.cloud.ibm.com/identity/token") → The endpoint to request an 
authentication token from IBM Cloud. 
• -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" → Sets the request header to 
indicate that the data is sent in form-encoded format. 
• -d (Data Payload) → Sends the required data: 
• grant_type=urn:ibm:params:oauth:grant-type:apikey → Specifies the OAuth grant type as 
API Key. 
• apikey=MY_IBM_CLOUD_API_KEY → Replace MY_IBM_CLOUD_API_KEY with your actual IBM 
Cloud API key. 
Expected Response: 
 
{  
"access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUz......sgrKIi8hdFs",  
"refresh_token": "not_supported",  
"token_type": "Bearer",  
"expires_in": 3600,

Note: An IAM token is valid for up to 60 minutes, and it is subject to change. When a token expires, you 
must generate a new one. Use the property “expires_in” for the expiration of the IAM token that you 
have just created.

Quick start hands-on exercises  
Try the quick start exercises and notebooks for sample use cases to get started with using watsonx.ai.  
 Important notes:  
• Refer to developer access information section to use watsonx.ai credentials as you try the exercises.  
• Some of the exercises could include the usage of old model version. You can replace them with newer 
versions for better performance and output. To check the latest supported AI models on watsonx.ai, 
either follow selecting an AI model on Prompt Lab or refer to supported foundation models on 
watsonx.ai. 
• The hackathon provisioned cloud accounts do not support solution deployment. You can run your 
solution deployment locally on your machine and showcase them in your submissions. 
• Foundation model inferencing consumes tokens, which are measured as Resource Units (RUs). 
1,000 tokens = 1 RU, and each RU costs $0.0001 USD.  
Learn more about tokens and tokenization. 
• If you are using Jupyter Notebook editor on watsonx.ai, consider selecting a lower runtime 
environment to avoid high resource consumption and quickly depleting your credits.  Notebook runtimes 
are billed based on Capacity Unit Hours (CUH) at a rate of $1.02 USD per CUH.  
Learn more about capacity unit hours and watsonx.ai Studio pricing plans.
